# About #

This rep **is a modelsim 10.2c project**, the project is a Verilog implement of fast multiplier circuit.

Detail:

-  *using booth-radix 4 algorithm to generate partial product*
-  *using CSA based wallace-tree-like tree to compress partial product*
-  *a carry lookahead adder to do final compress.*

The description of compress tree can be found in the doc/CompressTreeDesign dir.
